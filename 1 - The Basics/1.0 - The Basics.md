# 1.0 - [The Basics](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html)
Swift is a language used to develop applications for all of Apple's major platforms, including iOS, tvOS, watchOS and of course macOS.

It is a **strongly-typed**, **type-safe** language, that includes the standard types (`Int`, `Double`, `Bool` etc.), as well as the standard collection types.

More uniquely, Swift contains `Tuples` for pairing values, and `Optionals` for telling whether a value is Set or Not Set (expressed as the value `nil`)
