# 1.1 [Constants and Variables](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID310)

As the names suggest, constants cannot be changed once they're set, whereas variables can.

### Declaring constants and variables

Constants are declared with the `let` keyword, whereas variables are declared with the `var` keyword, as in:

```Swift
let maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts = 10
var currentLoginAttempt = 0
```

This code can be read as: 
> Declare a new constant called maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts, and give it a value of 10. Then, declare a new variable called currentLoginAttempt, and give it an initial value of 0. 

### Type Annotations

Types can be assigned to variables when they are declared using a colon syntax as follows:

```Swift
var welcomeMessage: String
```

Note however that this practice is *rarely* necessary, as if you declare a variable with an initial value, Swift can ususally infer the type.

### Naming

Constants and variables can contain almost any character, including Unicode characters:

```Swift
let œÄ = 3.14159
let ‰Ω†Â•Ω = "‰Ω†Â•Ω‰∏ñÁïå"
let üê∂üêÆ = "dogcow"
```

Constant and variable names can‚Äôt contain whitespace characters, mathematical symbols, arrows, private-use (or invalid) Unicode code points, or line- and box-drawing characters. Nor can they begin with a number, although numbers may be included elsewhere within the name.

### Printing (e.g. to the console)

This is done with the `print(_:separator:terminator:)` function. Seperator and terminator are optional variables. Note that printing also supports string interpolation, using a \() syntax, as in:

```Swift
print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \(friendlyWelcome)")
// Prints "The current value of friendlyWelcome is Bonjour!"
```
