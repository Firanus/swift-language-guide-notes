# 1.10 [Booleans](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID328)

Swift contains Booleans, much as other languages. The Boolean type is called `Bool`, and there are literal values of `true` and `false`. Type safety constraints apply to bools as well:

```Swift
let i = 1
if i {
    // this example will not compile, and will report an error
}
```
```Swift
let i = 1
if i == 1 {
    // this example will compile successfully
}
```
