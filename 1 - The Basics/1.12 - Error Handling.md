# 1.12 [Error Handling](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID515)

Swift handles errors in a similar way to other languages, but with a few differences. There are 4 main keywords:
* `throws` - this keyword is added to a function to indicate it *can* throw an error. E.g. 
```Swift 
func canThrowAnError() throws {
    // this function may or may not throw an error
} 
```
* `do` - This creates a new scope in which multiple statements which can throw errors can be placed. These are then handled by...
* `catch` - These blocks contain code for handling errors.
* `try` - This keyword is placed before calling functions which can throw errors in a `do` block.

The `do`, `catch` and `try` are used as follows:
```Swift
do {
    try canThrowAnError()
    // no error was thrown
} catch {
    // an error was thrown
}
```

Putting it all together:
```Swift
func makeASandwich() throws {
    // ...
}
 
do {
    try makeASandwich()
    eatASandwich()
} catch SandwichError.outOfCleanDishes {
    washDishes()
} catch SandwichError.missingIngredients(let ingredients) {
    buyGroceries(ingredients)
}
```
