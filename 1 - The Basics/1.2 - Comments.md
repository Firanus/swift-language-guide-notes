# 1.2 [Comments](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID315)

Comments are very similar to C, in that the character to start a single line comment is `//`, and multi-line comments are created using `/* */`. E.g.

```Swift
// This is a comment.

/* This is also a comment
 but is written over multiple lines. */
 ```
 
 ### Nested multi-line comments
 Swift actually supports nested multi-line comments, which makes it easier to block and unblock large chunks of code.

```
/* This is the start of the first multiline comment.
 /* This is the second, nested multiline comment. */
 This is the end of the first multiline comment. */
```
