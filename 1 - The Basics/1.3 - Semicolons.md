# 1.3 [Semicolons](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID316)

Swift doesn't require you to use semi-colons at the end of lines, though you can if you want. Generally, this is not recommended.

The exception is if you want to have multiple statements in a single line. This, however, is to be avoided in almost all circumstances.

```Swift
let cat = "🐱"; print(cat)
// Prints "🐱"
```
