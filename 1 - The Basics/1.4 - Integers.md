# 1.4 [Integers](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID317)

Swift provides signed (i.e. +ve -ve, or 0) and unsigned (i.e. +ve or 0) integers of 8,16,32 and 64 bit sizes. The types follow a C-like naming convention, i.e.:
* An unsigned 8 bit integer has type `UInt8`
* A signed 32 bit integer has type `Int32`

### Integer bounds

These can be accessed by looking at the min and max properties of the integer types. i.e.

```Swift
let minValue = UInt8.min  // minValue is equal to 0, and is of type UInt8
let maxValue = UInt8.max  // maxValue is equal to 255, and is of type UInt8
```

### `Int`
Swift provides an `Int` type that should be used in almost all circumstances. This defaults to the *native word size* of your machine. E.g. on a 64 bit machine, this defaults to `Int64`

### `UInt`
Provides the same functionality as `Int` for unsigned integers. E.g. on a 64 bit machine, the default `UInt` is `UInt64`
