# 1.5 [Floating Point Numbers](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID321)

i.e. numbers with a fractional component.

As with most other typed languages, Swift provides 2 key floating point types:
* `Double` - represents a 64-bit floating point number. This number is precise to at least 15 decimal places.
* `Float` - represents a 32-bit floating-point number. This number is precise to at least 6 decimal places.

In situations where either would do, `Double` is preferred.
