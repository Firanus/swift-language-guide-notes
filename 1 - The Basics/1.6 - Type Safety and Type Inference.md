# 1.6 [Type Safety and Type Inference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID322)

Swift is a *type safe* language, which means that it will perform *type checks* when compiling your code and flag any mismatched types as errors.

However, Swift also has *type inference*, which automatically works out the type of particular variables to prevent the user from having to explicitly declare the type of all their variables.

Often this is done by initialising vairables with *literal values* (i.e. values that appear explicitly in your code). For example:

```Swift
let meaningOfLife = 42
// meaningOfLife is inferred to be of type Int

let pi = 3.14159
// pi is inferred to be of type Double
```

If you mix integers and floating point numbers when declaring initialising a number, it gives it a type of `Double`, as below:

```Swift
let anotherPi = 3 + 0.14159
// anotherPi is also inferred to be of type Double
```
