# 1.7 [Numeric Literals](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID323)

### Integers

Integer literals can be declared be written using 1 of 4 bases:
* *decimal* numbers, with no prefix
* *binary* numbers, with a `0b` prefix
* *octal* numbers, with a `0o` prefix
* *hexadecimal* numbers, with a `0x` prefix

Seen in code (all these numebrs represent 17):

```Swift
let decimalInteger = 17
let binaryInteger = 0b10001       // 17 in binary notation
let octalInteger = 0o21           // 17 in octal notation
let hexadecimalInteger = 0x11     // 17 in hexadecimal notation
```

### Floating Point

Floating point literals can be *decimal* or *hexadecimal*. They must have a number of the appropriate type both before and after the floating point. They can also have an exponent (`e` or `E` for decimals, `p` or `P` for hexadecimals). E.g.

For decimals with an exponent, the number is multiplied by 10<sup>exp</sup>. e.g:
* 1.25e2 means 1.25 x 10<sup>2</sup>, or 125.0.
* 1.25e-2 means 1.25 x 10<sup>-2</sup>, or 0.0125.

For hexadecimals with an exponent, the number is multiplied by 2<sup>exp</sup>. e.g.:
* 0xFp2 means 15 x 2<sup>2</sup>, or 60.0.
* 0xFp-2 means 15 x 2<sup>-2</sup>, or 3.75.

In code (all these numbers represent 12.1875):
```Swift
let decimalDouble = 12.1875
let exponentDouble = 1.21875e1
let hexadecimalDouble = 0xC.3p0 //As 3/16 = .1875
```

### Formatting
Swift also allows the user to pad numbers with extra zeros, and add underscores for improved readability. E.g.

```Swift
let paddedDouble = 000123.456
let oneMillion = 1_000_000
let justOverOneMillion = 1_000_000.000_000_1

```
