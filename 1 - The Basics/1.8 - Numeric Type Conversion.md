# 1.8 [Numeric Type Conversion](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID324)

Use `Int` for all integer needs where another integer is not explicitly required. Such needs might include specifically typed date from an external source or necessary performance or memory optimizations.

### Integer Type Conversion

If you try to put an Integer into a type that does not support it (e.g. a -ve number in a UInt), an error will be thrown.

Because numerics can store different ranges of values, to pick a specific type, you have to explicitly "opt-in" by declaring the type.

Note that you cannot add different types of Integer together. In the example below, we have to convert the `UInt8` into a `UInt16` before the addition can go ahead.

```Swift
let twoThousand: UInt16 = 2_000
let one: UInt8 = 1
let twoThousandAndOne = twoThousand + UInt16(one)
```

### Floating Point and Integer Conversion

Conversions from floating point to integer and vice versa must be made explicitly. In the example below, if we had not made the conversion, the addition would not have been allowed to go ahead.

```Swift
let three = 3
let pointOneFourOneFiveNine = 0.14159
let pi = Double(three) + pointOneFourOneFiveNine
// pi equals 3.14159, and is inferred to be of type Double
```

Note that this is not the case if you add Numeric Literals, because they do not have an explicit type.
