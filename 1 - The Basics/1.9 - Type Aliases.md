# 1.9 [Type Aliases](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID327)

*Type aliases* allow you to define an alternate name for an existing type by using the `typealias` keyword. This can be useful if the alternate name makes more sense contextually. e.g.

```Swift
typealias AudioSample = UInt16
```

Once defined, it can be used anywhere in place of the type:

```Swift
var maxAmplitudeFound = AudioSample.min
// maxAmplitudeFound is now 0
```
