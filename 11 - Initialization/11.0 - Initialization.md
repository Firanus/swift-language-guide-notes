# 11.0 - [Initialization](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html)

Initialization is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure or enumeration for use. This can involve setting initial values and any other setup work that needs to be done. Initialization can be performed by setting up *initializers*. In addition, one can also implement *deinitializers*, which can perform custom cleanup for a class is de-allocated. This is covered in the deinitialization section
