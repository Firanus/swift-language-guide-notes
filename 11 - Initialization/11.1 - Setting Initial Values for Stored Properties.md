# 11.1 [Setting Initial Values for Stored Properties](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID204)

Stored Properties must have their initial values set to an appropriate value by the time the instance of that class or structure (remember, enumerations cannot have stored properties) is created. This can be done either by using an initializer, or by giving the property a default value as part of its definition.

## Initializers

In its simplest form, an initializer is like an instance method with no parameters (or return type) written using the `init` keyword:

```Swift
init() {
    // perform some initialization here
}
```

The example below shows how this might be employed in a class called Farenheit:
```Swift
struct Fahrenheit {
    var temperature: Double
    init() {
        temperature = 32.0
    }
}
var f = Fahrenheit()
print("The default temperature is \(f.temperature)° Fahrenheit")
// Prints "The default temperature is 32.0° Fahrenheit"
```

## Default Property Values

The other way to assign initial values to stored properties is to give them a default value. If we were to replicate the above Farhenheit structure, this would look like:

```Swift
struct Fahrenheit {
    var temperature = 32.0
}
```
