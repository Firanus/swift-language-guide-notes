# 11.10 [Setting a Default Property Value with a Closure or Function](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID232)

If a stored property’s default value requires some customization or setup, you can use a closure or global function to provide a customized default value for that property. Whenever a new instance of the type that the property belongs to is initialized, the closure or function is called, and its return value is assigned as the property’s default value.

An skeleton implementation is shown below:

```Swift
class SomeClass {
    let someProperty: SomeType = {
        // create a default value for someProperty inside this closure
        // someValue must be of the same type as SomeType
        return someValue
    }()
}
```

Note the use `=` to indicate it's a default value, note a computed property, and the `()` immediately after the closing brace, to indicate it should execute immediately. Otherwise, you will just be assigning the closure to the property.
