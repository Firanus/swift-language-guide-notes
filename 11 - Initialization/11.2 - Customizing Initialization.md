# 11.2 [Customizing Initialization](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID208)

We can customize the initialization process with input parameters, optional property types or by assigning constant properties during initialization.

## Initialization Parameters

You can provide initialization parameters to your intializer to help set up your class or structure. For example, in the class Celsius below, we have two intializers with different initialization parameters:

```Swift
struct Celsius {
    var temperatureInCelsius: Double
    init(fromFahrenheit fahrenheit: Double) {
        temperatureInCelsius = (fahrenheit - 32.0) / 1.8
    }
    init(fromKelvin kelvin: Double) {
        temperatureInCelsius = kelvin - 273.15
    }
}
let boilingPointOfWater = Celsius(fromFahrenheit: 212.0)
// boilingPointOfWater.temperatureInCelsius is 100.0
let freezingPointOfWater = Celsius(fromKelvin: 273.15)
// freezingPointOfWater.temperatureInCelsius is 0.0
```

Because initializers don't have an identifying method name, their argument labels are even more important than they are for methods. Because of this, Swift provides *automatic* argument labels for every parameter in an initializer.

The example below allows a user to define colors using one of two initializers:

```Swift
struct Color {
    let red, green, blue: Double
    init(red: Double, green: Double, blue: Double) {
        self.red   = red
        self.green = green
        self.blue  = blue
    }
    init(white: Double) {
        red   = white
        green = white
        blue  = white
    }
}
```
To use the intializers, you have to provide names values for the parameters: 
```Swift
let magenta = Color(red: 1.0, green: 0.0, blue: 1.0)
let halfGray = Color(white: 0.5)
```

Note that you **cannot** call the initializers without the argument labels. Trying to do so will report a compile-time error:

```Swift
let veryGreen = Color(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
// this reports a compile-time error - argument labels are required
```

If you absolutely do not want to have an argument label, you can avoid it by explicitly providing `_` as the argument label. For instance, in an abridged version of our earlier Celsius structure:

```Swift
struct Celsius {
    var temperatureInCelsius: Double
    init(_ celsius: Double) {
        temperatureInCelsius = celsius
    }
}
let bodyTemperature = Celsius(37.0)
// bodyTemperature.temperatureInCelsius is 37.0

```

## Optional Properties

If you know that you do not want a property to have a value set when you create an instance of the object, you should declare it as an optional property. This will then automatically be set to `nil` when you instantiate the class or structure.

## Assigning Constant Properties during Initialization

You are also allowed to set constant properties to any value during the initialization process, as long as they are set to a definite value by the end of the process.

Note that in a class, you can only assign variable to constants introduced by it, not to any constants that it inherits from a superclass.
