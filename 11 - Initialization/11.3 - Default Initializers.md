# 11.3 [Default Initializers](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID213)

## Classes

Swift provides a *default initializer* to any class that:
* provides default values to all its properties
* does not provide at least 1 initializer itself

An example for a simple ShoppingList class is shown below:
```Swift
class ShoppingListItem {
    var name: String?
    var quantity = 1
    var purchased = false
}
var item = ShoppingListItem()
```

## Structures

Stucture types automatically receive a *member-wise initalizer* if they do not define their own initializer. It allows initial values of the structure's properties to be passed by name, and works *even if* the properties are not given default values. An example for a Size structure with an automatically generated `init(width:,height:)` intializer is shown below.

```Swift
struct Size {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0
}
let twoByTwo = Size(width: 2.0, height: 2.0)
```
