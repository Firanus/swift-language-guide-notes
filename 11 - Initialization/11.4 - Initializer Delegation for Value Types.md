# 11.4 [Initializer Delegation for Value Types](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID215)

Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an instance's initialization. This is called *Initializer Delegation*, and prevents code duplication.

The rules for value types (Structures, Enumerations) and Classes are different, because classes support inheritance. In this note, we will cover value types.

To use other intializers in a value type, you can call them using `self.init`. Note that this works because even if a type has many initializers, they will all have a unique signature, which can be specified by naming the parameters called.

Remember also that the default initializers for both classes and value types are not available if you define a custom initializer. If you want to maintain the default initializer while writing a custom initializer, consider writing it as an extension (covered in another note).

An example of a class (`Rect`) with multiple initializers, one of which uses initializer delegation, is shown below.

```Swift
struct Size {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0
}
struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}

struct Rect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()
    init() {}
    init(origin: Point, size: Size) {
        self.origin = origin
        self.size = size
    }
    init(center: Point, size: Size) {
        let originX = center.x - (size.width / 2)
        let originY = center.y - (size.height / 2)
        self.init(origin: Point(x: originX, y: originY), size: size)
    }
}
```
