# 11.5 [Class Inheritance and Initialization](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID216)

All of a class's stored properties, including properties inherited from a superclass, must be given an initial value during initialization. To facilitate this, Swift defines two kinds of initializer: designated initializers and convenience initializers.

* **Designated Initializers** are the primary initializers for a class. They fully initialize all properties introduced by that class and call a superclass initializer to continue initialization up the class tree.

  Every class must have at least one dedicated initializer. Typically, classes will have very few desginated initializers, and it is not at all unusual for a class to have only one.
  
  They are initialized using the `init` keyword:
  ```Swift
  init(parameters) {
    //statements...
  }
  ```
  
* **Convenience Initializers** are secondary, supporting initializers for a class. You can define a convenience initializer to call a designated initializer with certain default values. You can also define convenience initializers to handle specific inputs or use cases.
  Convenience initializers are entirely optional. Only create them if a shortcut to a common initialization pattern will save time or make the initialization of the class clearer in intent.
  Convenience initializers are written in the same style, but have the `convenience` modifier put before the `init` keyword:
  ```Swift
  convenience init(parameters) {
    // statements
  }
  ```
## Initializer Delegation for Class Types

To simplify the relationships between designated and convenience initializers, Swift applies the following three rules for delegation calls between initializers:

1. A designated initializer must call a designated initializer from its immediate superclass.

2. A convenience initializer must call another initializer from the same class.

3. A convenience initializer must ultimately call a designated initializer.

A simple way to remember this is:

* Designated initializers must always delegate *up*.
* Convenience initializers must always delegate *across*.

These rules are illustrated in the figure below:

In more complex classes, designated initializers often act as "funnel" points for initialization, simplifying the interrelationships between classes in the chain. The following diagram illustrates this:
