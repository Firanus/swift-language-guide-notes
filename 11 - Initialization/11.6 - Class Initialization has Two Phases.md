# 11.6 [Class Initialization has Two Phases](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID220)

Class initialization in Swift is a two phase process.

In the first phase, each stored property is assigned an initial value by the class the introduced it. In the second phase, each class is then given the opportunity to customise its stored properties further before the class is ready to use. This process prevents property values from being accessed before they're ready to use, and from being set to a different value by another initializer unexpectedly.

## Safety Checks

In addition, Swift's compiler does 4 safety checks to ensure that two-phase inititalisation has completed without error:

#### Safety check 1
A designated initializer must ensure that all of the properties introduced by its class are initialized before it delegates up to a superclass initializer.

#### Safety check 2
A designated initializer must delegate up to a superclass initializer before assigning a value to an inherited property. If it doesn’t, the new value the designated initializer assigns will be overwritten by the superclass as part of its own initialization.

#### Safety check 3
A convenience initializer must delegate to another initializer before assigning a value to any property (including properties defined by the same class). If it doesn’t, the new value the convenience initializer assigns will be overwritten by its own class’s designated initializer.

#### Safety check 4
An initializer cannot call any instance methods, read the values of any instance properties, or refer to self as a value until after the first phase of initialization is complete.

## Phase Process

In order to satisfy these 4 safety checks, Phase 1 and 2 follow a simple process. In Phase 1, each class's designated initialiser initialises the properties it introduced, and then passes the initialisation up the class tree to its superclass's designated initialiser. Convenience initialisers have nothing to do in Phase 1. The diagram below illustrates this:

Phase 2 begins as soon as the top-most class completes its initialisation of properties. In this phase, initialisation continues back down the chain, with each designated initialiser being given the opportunity to customise any properties it has access to. If a convenience initialiser has been called, it does its initalisation last.
