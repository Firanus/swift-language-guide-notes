# 11.8 [Failable Initialisers](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID224)

Swift also allows users to define initialisers that can fail (for instance, if a required external resource is unavailable, or a initialisation param is given an invalid value). To create such an initialiser, simply put a question mark after the init keyword `init?`.

Note that you cannot define a failable and a nonfailable initializer with the same parameter types and names.

As the `init?` syntax suggests, failable initialisers creates *optionals* of the types they are intended to initialise. As such, to indicate an initialiser has failed, you simply `return nil` (though, because initialisers actually do not return values, rather, they set up `self`, you do not need to `return` in the case of a success.)

For example, the animal class below defines a failable initialiser:

```Swift
struct Animal {
    let species: String
    init?(species: String) {
        if species.isEmpty { return nil }
        self.species = species
    }
}
```

Note that enumerations with raw values (see note 13.4) automatically come with a failable initialiser, `init?(rawValue:)`

Note that failable initialisers can override and delegate to both failable and non-failable initialisers.

Note also that you can create initialisers that return implicitly unwrapped optionals by using the `init!` syntax. The same considerations apply here as when using implicitly unwrapped optionals normally.
