# 11.9 [Required Initialisers](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID231)

Write the `required` modifier before the definition of a class initializer to indicate that every subclass of the class must implement that initializer:

```Swift
class SomeClass {
    required init() {
        // initializer implementation goes here
    }
}
```

You must also write the required modifier before every subclass implementation of a required initializer, to indicate that the initializer requirement applies to further subclasses in the chain. You do not write the override modifier when overriding a required designated initializer:

```Swift
class SomeSubclass: SomeClass {
    required init() {
        // subclass implementation of the required initializer goes here
    }
}
```

You do not have to provide an explicit implementation of a required initializer if you can satisfy the requirement with an inherited initializer.
