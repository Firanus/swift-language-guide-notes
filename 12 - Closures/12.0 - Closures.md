# 12.0 [Closures](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html)

Closures are self-contained blocks of functionality that can be passed around and used in your code.

Closures can capture and store references to any constants and variables from the context in which they are defined. This is known as *closing over* those constants and variables. Swift handles all of the memory management of capturing for you.

Global and nested functions, introduced in the [Functions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Functions.html) section, are actually special cases of closures. Closures take one of three forms:

* Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values.
* Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.
* Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.

Swift makes a number of optimizations to simplify syntax in these scenarios. They include:
* Inferring parameter and return value types from context
* Implicit returns from single-expression closures
* Shorthand argument names
* Trailing closure syntax
