# 12.2 [Trailing Closures](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH11-ID102)

If you need to pass a closure expression to a function as the expression's final argument Swift also allows a alternate syntax called *trailing closures*. It is written after a function call's closing parenthesis (`)`), even though it is still an argument to the function. When using this syntax, you don't need to write the argument label for the closure. For example:

```Swift
func someFunctionThatTakesAClosure(closure: () -> Void) {
    // function body goes here
}
 
// Here's how you call this function without using a trailing closure:
 
someFunctionThatTakesAClosure(closure: {
    // closure's body goes here
})
 
// Here's how you call this function with a trailing closure instead:
 
someFunctionThatTakesAClosure() {
    // trailing closure's body goes here
}
```

If we take our example function from [the previous note](/12%20-%20Closures/12.0%20-%20Closure%20Expressions.md), we can rewrite it using a trailing closure:

```Swift
reversedNames = names.sorted() { $0 > $1 }
```

When a closure expression is provided as a function or method's only argument, and you provide it as a trailing closure, you do not need the parentheses (`()`) after the function's name:

```Swift
reversedNames = names.sorted { $0 > $1 }
```

Trailing closures are most useful in cases when the closure cannot be fit onto a single line.
