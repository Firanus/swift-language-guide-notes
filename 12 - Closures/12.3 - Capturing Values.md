# 12.3 [Capturing Values](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH11-ID103)

A closure can *capture* constants and variables from the surrounding context in which it is defined. It can then refer to those constants and variables in its body, even if the original scope no longer exists.

In Swift, the simplest version of a closure that captures values is a nested function. For example, the following `incrementor()` function captures two parameters, `amount` and `runningTotal`:

```Swift
func makeIncrementer(forIncrement amount: Int) -> () -> Int {
    var runningTotal = 0
    func incrementer() -> Int {
        runningTotal += amount
        return runningTotal
    }
    return incrementer
}
```

The total `makeIncrementor(forIncrement: Int)` function returns a function of type `() -> Int`. It takes no parameters, but is able to increment the `runningTotal` parameter repeatedly, as shown:

```Swift
let incrementByTen = makeIncrementer(forIncrement: 10)

incrementByTen()
// returns a value of 10
incrementByTen()
// returns a value of 20
incrementByTen()
// returns a value of 30
```

It does this by capturing **a reference** to the `amount` and `runningTotal` parameters when it is first called. This gives it access to the parameters long after the initial `makeIncrementor` function has finished executing.

>As an optimization, Swift may instead capture and store a copy of a value if that value is not mutated by a closure, and if the value is not mutated after the closure is created.

>Swift also handles all memory management involved in disposing of variables when they are no longer needed.
