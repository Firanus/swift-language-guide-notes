# 12.4 [Closures are Reference Types](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Closures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH11-ID104)

Functions and closures in Swift are **reference types**. When you assign a function or a closure to a variable (or constant) in Swift, you are actually setting that variable (or constant) to be a reference to that function or closure.

As a result, standard principles of copying by reference apply. E.g. If you assign a closure to two different constants or variables, they will actually refer to the same closure:

```Swift
let alsoIncrementByTen = incrementByTen
alsoIncrementByTen()
// returns a value of 40
```
