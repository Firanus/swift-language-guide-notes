# 13.0 [Enumerations](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html)

An *enumeration* is a type that defines a group of common values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way.

In languages like C, the cases of enumerations are all assigned, explicitly or implicitly, to integer values. In Swift there is no such restriction; you do not have to assign such an integer values to your cases, and if you do wish to assign such a value (called a *raw value*) your case, you can provide any string, character, a integer or floating-point type.

You can also specify *associated data* of any type to be stored along with each of your case values

Enumerations in Swift are first class types in their own right. They have access to many features usually available only to classes, such as computed properties which can provide additional information about the enumeration's current value, and instance methods to provide functionality related to the case. They can also have initializers defined against them, be extended to provide additional functionality, and be made to conform to protocols.

For information on any of these items, please see the appropriate section.
