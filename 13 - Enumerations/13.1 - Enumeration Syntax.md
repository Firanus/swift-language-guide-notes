# 13.1 [Enumeration Syntax](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH12-ID146)

Enums are introduced using the `enum` keyword:

```Swift
enum SomeEnumeration {
    // enumeration definition goes here
}
```

*Enumeration cases* can then be added using the `case` keyword:

```Swift
enum CompassPoint {
    case north
    case south
    case east
    case west
}
```

Multiple cases can be defined on a single line using commas (`,`):

```Swift
enum Planet {
    case mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, saturn, uranus, neptune
}
```

When defining an enum, like with classes and structures, make sure to use capital letters, and give it a singular rather than a plural name so that they read as self-evident:

```Swift
var directionToHead = CompassPoint.west
```

Finally, if we were to redeclare this variable, because we have already defined the type, type-inference allows us to use the shorter dot syntax.

```Swift
directionToHead = .east
```
