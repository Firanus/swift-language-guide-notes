# 13.2 [Matching Enumeration Values with a Switch Statement](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH12-ID147)

You can match individual cases of an `enum` using a `switch` statement. Note the use of the shorter dot syntax:

```Swift
directionToHead = .south
switch directionToHead {
case .north:
    print("Lots of planets have a north")
case .south:
    print("Watch out for penguins")
case .east:
    print("Where the sun rises")
case .west:
    print("Where the skies are blue")
}
// Prints "Watch out for penguins"
```

As with other `switch` statements, you must provide an exhaustive list of all cases. If we had ommited one of the options above the code would have refused to compile.

However, as usual, you can use a `default` case to handle any cases you do not need specific behaviour for:

```Swift
let somePlanet = Planet.earth
switch somePlanet {
case .earth:
    print("Mostly harmless")
default:
    print("Not a safe place for humans")
}
// Prints "Mostly harmless"
```
