# 13.5 [Recursive Enumerations](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Enumerations.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH12-ID536)

A *recursive enumeration* is an enumeration that has another instance of the enumeration as the associated value for one or more of the enumeration cases. You indicate that an enumeration case is recursive by writing `indirect` before it, which tells the compiler to insert the necessary layer of indirection.

For example, this is an enumeration that stores arithmetic expressions:

```Swift
enum ArithmeticExpression {
    case number(Int)
    indirect case addition(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
    indirect case multiplication(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
}
```

You can also write `indirect` before the `enum` keyword to allow indirection for all the cases that have an associated value:

```Swift
indirect enum ArithmeticExpression {
    case number(Int)
    case addition(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
    case multiplication(ArithmeticExpression, ArithmeticExpression)
}
```

Recursive enumerations are useful because they make it possible to nest enumerations. For instance, we could express `(5 + 4) * 2` using the following code:

```Swift
let five = ArithmeticExpression.number(5)
let four = ArithmeticExpression.number(4)
let sum = ArithmeticExpression.addition(five, four)
let product = ArithmeticExpression.multiplication(sum, ArithmeticExpression.number(2))
```

A straightforward to handle recursive enumerations is to pair them with a recursive function. For instance, the following function evaluates an arithmetic expression:

```Swift
func evaluate(_ expression: ArithmeticExpression) -> Int {
    switch expression {
    case let .number(value):
        return value
    case let .addition(left, right):
        return evaluate(left) + evaluate(right)
    case let .multiplication(left, right):
        return evaluate(left) * evaluate(right)
    }
}
 
print(evaluate(product))
// Prints "18"
```
