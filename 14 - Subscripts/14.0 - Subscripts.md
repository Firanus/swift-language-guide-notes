# 14.0 [Subscripts](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Subscripts.html)

Classes, structures and enumerations can define *subscripts*, which are shortcuts for accessing the member elements of a collection, list, or sequence (e.g. `someArray[3]`).

You can define multiple subscripts for a single type, and the appropriate subscript overload to use is selected based on the type of the index value you pass to the subscript. Subscripts are not limited to a single dimension, and you can define subscripts with multiple input parameters to suit your custom typeâ€™s needs.
