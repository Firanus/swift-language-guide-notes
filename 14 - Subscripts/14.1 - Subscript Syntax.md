# 14.1 [Subscript Syntax](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Subscripts.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH16-ID306)

Subscripts enable you to query instances of a type by writing one or more values in square brackets after the instance name. How you define them for your custom types is up to you, Normally, Swift uses subscripts as a shortcut for accessing the elements in a list, sequence or collection. For example, in a dictionary:

```Swift
var numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
numberOfLegs["bird"] = 2
```

Their syntax combines elements of instance methods (you can define input parameter(s) and a return value) and computed property syntax (you define getters and setters, and they are read-write or read-only). To define a subscript, use the `subscript` keyword:

```Swift
subscript(index: Int) -> Int {
    get {
        // return an appropriate subscript value here
    }
    set(newValue) {
        // perform a suitable setting action here
    }
}
```

The type of `newValue` is the same as the return type of the subscript. As with computed properties:
* You can choose not to specify the setterâ€™s (newValue) parameter. A default parameter called newValue is provided to your setter if you do not provide one yourself.
* You can simplify read-only subscripts by omitting the `get` keyword and its associated braces:
   ```Swift
   subscript(index: Int) -> Int {
    // return an appropriate subscript value here
   }
   ```
