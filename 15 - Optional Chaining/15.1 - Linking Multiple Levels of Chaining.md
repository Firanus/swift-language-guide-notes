# 15.1 [Linking Multiple Levels of Chaining](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/OptionalChaining.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH21-ID252)

You can link together multiple levels of chaining. Note, however that there is no such thing as "multiple levels of optionality". A class is either Optional or it is not. In other words:

* If the type you are trying to retrieve is not optional, it will become optional because of the optional chaining.

* If the type you are trying to retrieve is already optional, it will not become more optional because of the chaining.

So if we wanted to retrieve the street property of an optional `address` class, our code might look like this:

```Swift
if let johnsStreet = john.residence?.address?.street {
    print("John's street name is \(johnsStreet).")
} else {
    print("Unable to retrieve the address.")
}
// Prints "Unable to retrieve the address."
```

If either residence or address is set to `nil`, johnsStreet will be `nil`. The type of johnsStreet itself is `String?`, because `street` is of type `String`.

## Optional Chaining With Methods

You can also use Optional Chaining with methods that return Optional types. When you do so, add your `?` *after the `()`*, because you are chaining on the method's return value. For example:

```Swift
if let beginsWithThe =
    john.residence?.address?.buildingIdentifier()?.hasPrefix("The") {
    if beginsWithThe {
        print("John's building identifier begins with \"The\".")
    } else {
        print("John's building identifier does not begin with \"The\".")
    }
}
// Prints "John's building identifier begins with "The"."
```
