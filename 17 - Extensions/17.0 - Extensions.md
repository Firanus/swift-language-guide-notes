# 17.0 [Extensions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Extensions.html)

*Extensions* add new functionality to an existing class, structure, enumeration, or protocol type. This includes the ability to extend types for which you do not have access to the original source code (known as *retroactive modeling*).

* Add computed instance properties and computed type properties
* Define instance methods and type methods
* Provide new convenience initializers
* Define subscripts
* Define and use new nested types
* Make an existing type conform to a protocol

The basic syntax for an extension is:

```Swift
extension SomeType {
    // new functionality to add to SomeType goes here
}
```

The particular new functionality you want to implement is written in the same way you would write it as if you had access to the class you were extending.
