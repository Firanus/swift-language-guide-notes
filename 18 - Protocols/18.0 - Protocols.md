# 18.0 [Protocols](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html)

A *protocol* defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be *adopted* by a class, structure, or enumeration to provide an actual implementation of those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol is said to *conform* to that protocol.

In addition to specifying requirements that conforming types must implement, you can extend a protocol to implement some of these requirements or to implement additional functionality that conforming types can take advantage of.

Protocols are declared using the `protocol` keyword:

```Swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    // protocol definition goes here
}
```

A type says that it implements a protocol by placing a colon after its name. Multiple protocols can be specified, and are seperated by colons:

```Swift
struct SomeStructure: FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // structure definition goes here
}
```

If a class has a superclass, list the superclass name before any protocols it adopts:

```Swift
class SomeClass: SomeSuperclass, FirstProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // class definition goes here
}
```
