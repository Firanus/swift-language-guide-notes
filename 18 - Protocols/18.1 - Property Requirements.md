# 18.1 [Property Requirements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID269)

A protocol can require any conforming type to provide an instance property or type property with a particular name and type. The protocol doesn’t specify whether the property should be a stored property or a computed property—it only specifies the required property name and type. The protocol also specifies whether each property must be gettable or gettable and settable.

If a property needs to be gettable and settable it cannot be a read-only computed property, or a constant stored property.

If a property needs to be gettable only, it can have any implementation. It can also be made settable if this is useful in your code.

Property requirements are always declared as variable properties, prefixed with the `var` keyword. Gettable and settable properties are indicated by writing `{ get set }` after their type declaration, and gettable properties are indicated by writing `{ get }`.

```Swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    var mustBeSettable: Int { get set }
    var doesNotNeedToBeSettable: Int { get }
}
```

Type properties are always prefixed by the `static` keyword:

```Swift
protocol AnotherProtocol {
    static var someTypeProperty: Int { get set }
}
```

Here is as very minimalist example of a protocol, and a struct that implements it:

```Swift
protocol FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String { get }
}

struct Person: FullyNamed {
    var fullName: String
}
let john = Person(fullName: "John Appleseed")
// john.fullName is "John Appleseed"
```
