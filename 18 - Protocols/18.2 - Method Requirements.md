# 18.2 [Method Requirements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID270)

Protocols can require specific instance methods and type methods to be implemented by conforming types. When specifying a method, all you need to define it its *signature*, i.e. its name, parameters, and return type. You **do not** specify a method body.

As with normal method definitions, method requirements are defined using the `func` keyword. You can specify type methods by prefixing func with `static`:

```Swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    static func someTypeMethod()
}
```
If you are defining a method that will need to mutate instances of any type it is implemented in, mark it with the `mutating` keyword. This will allow it to be implemented by any `struct` and `enum` that conforms to the protocol:

```Swift
protocol Togglable {
    mutating func toggle()
}
```

Here is an example of an enum that implements `Tooglable`:

```Swift
enum OnOffSwitch: Togglable {
    case off, on
    mutating func toggle() {
        switch self {
        case .off:
            self = .on
        case .on:
            self = .off
        }
    }
}
var lightSwitch = OnOffSwitch.off
lightSwitch.toggle()
// lightSwitch is now equal to .on
```
