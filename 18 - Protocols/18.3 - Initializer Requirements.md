# 18.3 [Initializer Requirements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID272)

Protocols can also specify initializers to be implemented by conforming types. As with methods, you do not specify a body:

```Swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    init(someParameter: Int)
}
```

## Class Implementations of Protocol Initializer Requirements

You can implement a protocol initializer requirement on a conforming class as either a designated or a convenience initializer. In both cases, you must mark it with the `required` keyword, as all subclasses of the conforming class must either implement or inherit the initializer. The only exception to this rule is if the conforming type is a class marked as `final` (meaning it cannot be subclasses):

```Swift
class SomeClass: SomeProtocol {
    required init(someParameter: Int) {
        // initializer implementation goes here
    }
}
```

Finally, if a subclass overrides a designated initializer from a superclass, and also implements a matching initializer requirement from a protocol, mark the initializer implementation with both the `required` and `override` modifiers:

```Swift
protocol SomeProtocol {
    init()
}
 
class SomeSuperClass {
    init() {
        // initializer implementation goes here
    }
}
 
class SomeSubClass: SomeSuperClass, SomeProtocol {
    // "required" from SomeProtocol conformance; "override" from SomeSuperClass
    required override init() {
        // initializer implementation goes here
    }
}
```

## Failable Initializer Requirements

Protocols can define failable initializer requirements for conforming types, as defined in Failable Initializers.

A failable initializer requirement can be satisfied by a failable or nonfailable initializer on a conforming type. A nonfailable initializer requirement can be satisfied by a nonfailable initializer or an implicitly unwrapped failable initializer.
