# 18.4 [Protocols as Types](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID275)

Protocols don’t actually implement any functionality themselves. Nonetheless, any protocol you create will become a fully-fledged type for use in your code.

Because it’s a type, you can use a protocol in many places where other types are allowed, including:

* As a parameter type or return type in a function, method, or initializer
* As the type of a constant, variable, or property
* As the type of items in an array, dictionary, or other container

Here is an example of a class using a protocol as a type. (The `RandomNumberGenerator` type is a protocol)"

```Swift
class Dice {
    let sides: Int
    let generator: RandomNumberGenerator
    init(sides: Int, generator: RandomNumberGenerator) {
        self.sides = sides
        self.generator = generator
    }
    func roll() -> Int {
        return Int(generator.random() * Double(sides)) + 1
    }
}
```

When using a protocol as a type like this, any class, struct or enum which conforms to the protocol can be used in its place. For instance, if we had a class `LinearCongruentialGenerator` that conformed to `RandomNumberGenerator`, we could pass that to the initialiser:

```Swift
var d6 = Dice(sides: 6, generator: LinearCongruentialGenerator())
for _ in 1...5 {
    print("Random dice roll is \(d6.roll())")
}
// Random dice roll is 3
// Random dice roll is 5
// Random dice roll is 4
// Random dice roll is 5
// Random dice roll is 4
```

## Collections of Protocol Types

You can also create collections where the type being stored is a protocol. Any type which conforms to the prototype can then be added to the collection.

```Swift
let things: [TextRepresentable] = [game, d12, simonTheHamster]

for thing in things {
    print(thing.textualDescription)
}
// A game of Snakes and Ladders with 25 squares
// A 12-sided dice
// A hamster named Simon
```
