# 18.6 [Adding Protocol Conformance with an Extension](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID277)

You can use extensions to make an existing class conform to a protocol even if you do not have access to its underlying source code. For instance, if we wanted to make our earlier Dice class conform to the following protocol:

```Swift
protocol TextRepresentable {
    var textualDescription: String { get }
}
```

We could do it using the following code:

```Swift
extension Dice: TextRepresentable {
    var textualDescription: String {
        return "A \(sides)-sided dice"
    }
}
```

## Declaring Protocol Adoption with an Extension

If a class already conforms to all the requirements of a protocol, but has not yet stated that it adopts to it, you can adopt it with an empty extension (see line 7):

```Swift
struct Hamster {
    var name: String
    var textualDescription: String {
        return "A hamster named \(name)"
    }
}
extension Hamster: TextRepresentable {}
```
