# 18.7 [Protocol Inheritance and Class-only Protocols](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID280)

Protocols can also inherit one or more other protocols and then add additional requirements on top of those it inherits. The syntax looks like:


```Swift
protocol InheritingProtocol: SomeProtocol, AnotherProtocol {
    // protocol definition goes here
}
```

You can use inheritance to restrict a protocol so that it can only be conformed to by classes. To do this, make sure that your protocol inherits the `AnyObject` type:

```Swift
protocol SomeClassOnlyProtocol: AnyObject, SomeInheritedProtocol {
    // class-only protocol definition goes here
}
```

Note however, that instead of using `AnyObject`, you can also use the keyword `class`. *However*, they do present a few minor differences when mixing your code with Objective C. [This article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30176814/whats-the-difference-between-a-protocol-extended-from-anyobject-and-a-class-onl) contains more information.

This is most appropriate to do when the behavior defined by that protocolâ€™s requirements assumes or requires that a conforming type has reference semantics rather than value semantics.
