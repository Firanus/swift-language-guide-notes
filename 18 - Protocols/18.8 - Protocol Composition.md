# 18.8 [Protocol Composition](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Protocols.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH25-ID282)

It can be useful to require a type to conform to several protocols at once. Swift allows this using *protocol composition*. The behaviour is as if you had created a temporary protocol which implemented the requirements of both protocols.

Protocol compositions take the form `SomeProtocol & AnotherProtocol`. You can include as many protocol as you need, each seperated by a `&`. Finally, it is also possible to include a **single superclass**, which any type must then inherit from.

An example use case is shown below. Note the use of protocol composition on line 11:

```Swift
protocol Named {
    var name: String { get }
}
protocol Aged {
    var age: Int { get }
}
struct Person: Named, Aged {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
}
func wishHappyBirthday(to celebrator: Named & Aged) {
    print("Happy birthday, \(celebrator.name), you're \(celebrator.age)!")
}
let birthdayPerson = Person(name: "Malcolm", age: 21)
wishHappyBirthday(to: birthdayPerson)
// Prints "Happy birthday, Malcolm, you're 21!"
```
