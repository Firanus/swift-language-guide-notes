# 2.0 [Basic Operators](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html)

Swift includes all the basic C operators, but makes improvements on several of them. e.g:
* = no longer returns a value to avoid confusion with ==
* Arithmetic operators detect and avoid value overflow

It also provides range operators to make it easier to express ranges of values.
