# 2.1 [Terminology](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID61)

Operators come in 3 varieties, *unary*, *binary*, and *ternary*.

1. *Unary* operators operate on a single target. They are either:
    * *prefix* operators, coming immediately before their target (e.g. -a)
    * *postfix* operators, coming immediately after their target (e.g. c!)

2. *Binary* operators, which operate on two targets. They are always *infix*, appearing between their two targets (e.g. a + b)
3. *Ternary* operators, which operate on 3 targets. Like C, Swift has only one, the ternary conditional (a ? b : c)

The values which operators affect are called *operands*
