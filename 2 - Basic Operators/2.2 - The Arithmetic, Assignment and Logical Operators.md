# 2.2 [The Assignment, Arithmetic and Logical Operators](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID62)

## Assignment Operators
The assignment operator (=) initializes or updates the value of a with b, e.g. `a = b`. It behaves as in C, but does not return a value. As a result, the following is **not** valid syntax:
```Swift
if x = y {
    // This is not valid, because x = y does not return a value.
}
```

Swift also provides **compound assignment operators**, as C does, which combine assignement with some other function. e.g. the += operator behaves as follows:
```Swift
var a = 1
a += 2
// a is now equal to 3
```
These also do not return a value.

## Aritmetic Operators
The *binary* arithmetic operators are:
* Addition - (+)
* Subtraction - (-)
* Multiplication - (*)
* Division - (/)
* Modulo (Remainder) - (%)

The *unary* aritmetic operator are:
* Minus operator (negates a number) - (-)
* Plus operator (no effect) - (+)

## Logical Operators

The Logical operators are the same as in C, namely
* NOT - (!a)
* AND - (a && b)
* OR - (a || b)

They can of course be chained together. When this happens they are *left-associative*, i.e. the left-most sub-expression is evaluated first. In other words, the following two expressions are equivalent:

`a && b || c`
`(a && b) || c`
