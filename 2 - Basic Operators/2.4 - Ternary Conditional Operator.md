# 2.4 [Ternary Conditional Operator](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#name="//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID71")

The ternary conditional operator works in the same way as it does in C. Namely this:
```Swift
question ? answer1 ? answer2
```

is equivalent to this:

```Swift
if question {
    answer1
} else {
    answer2
}
```

While very useful, be careful when using this operator. Used too liberally, it can make your code hard to read.
