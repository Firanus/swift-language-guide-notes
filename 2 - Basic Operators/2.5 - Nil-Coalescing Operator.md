# 2.5 [Nil-Coalescing Operator](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/BasicOperators.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH6-ID72)

The nil-coalescing operator `a ?? b`, unwraps an optional a if it contains a value, and returns b if it is `nil`. `a` must always be an optional type, and `b` must be the same type as the type stored in `a`.

It is shorthand for the following:
```Swift
a != nil ? a! : b
```
