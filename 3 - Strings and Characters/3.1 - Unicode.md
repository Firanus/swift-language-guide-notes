# 3.1 [Unicode](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID293)

Every instance of Swift's character type represents a **single extended graphene cluster**. In essence, each Character represents a sequence of unicode characters. For most characters this means they come one after another, but in special cases a character can be composed of multiple unicode scalars. e.g.
```Swift
let eAcute: Character = "\u{E9}"                         // é
let combinedEAcute: Character = "\u{65}\u{301}"          // e followed by ́
// eAcute is é, combinedEAcute is é
```
