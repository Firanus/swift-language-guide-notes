# 3.2 [Counting Characters](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID297)

You can count the number of characters in a string, using that string's `count` property. Note that because of the nature of single extended graphene clusters, adding a unicode character to a string won't necessarily increase the count. e.g,
```Swift
var word = "cafe"
print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafe is 4"
 
word += "\u{301}"    // COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, U+0301
 
print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafeÃÅ is 4"
```
