# 3.3 [Accessing and Modifying a String](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID494)

Every value in a Swift string has a property called its `Index` which corresponds to its position. However, because Strings are composed of unicode scalars, and the number of unicode scalars which compose an individual `Character` can vary, one cannot index Strings using Integers.

As a result there are three properties and two methods for indexing strings. They are:
* `startIndex` - This is a property of a String that shows where the first character is.
* `endIndex` - The position after the last character of the string. As a result, it isn't a valid property for a String's substring
* `indices` - For accessing all the indices in a String.
* `index(before:)`, `index(after:)` and `index(_:offsetBy:)` are methods to access the indices before or after a specific index.

Example uses of the above methods:
```Swift
let greeting = "Guten Tag!"
greeting[greeting.startIndex]
// G
greeting[greeting.index(before: greeting.endIndex)]
// !
greeting[greeting.index(after: greeting.startIndex)]
// u
let index = greeting.index(greeting.startIndex, offsetBy: 7)
greeting[index]
// a
for index in greeting.indices {
    print("\(greeting[index]) ", terminator: "")
}
// Prints "G u t e n   T a g ! "
```
As with arrays, one cannot access indices outside the bounds of the String:
```Swift
greeting[greeting.endIndex] // Error
greeting.index(after: greeting.endIndex) // Error
```

## Inserting and Removing
To insert a *single character* into a string at a specified index, use the `insert(_:at:)` method.
To insert the *contents of another string* at a specified index, use the `insert(contentsOf:at:)` method.
```Swift
var welcome = "hello"
welcome.insert("!", at: welcome.endIndex)
// welcome now equals "hello!"
 
welcome.insert(contentsOf: " there", at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there!"
```

Similarly, to remove a *single character* use the `remove(at:)` method, and to remove a substring at a specified range use the `removeSubrange(_:)` method.
```Swift
welcome.remove(at: welcome.index(before: welcome.endIndex))
// welcome now equals "hello there"
 
let range = welcome.index(welcome.endIndex, offsetBy: -6)..<welcome.endIndex
welcome.removeSubrange(range)
// welcome now equals "hello"
```
