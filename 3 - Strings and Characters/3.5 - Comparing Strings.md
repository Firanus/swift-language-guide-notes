# 3.5 [Comparing Strings](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID298)

Swift provides 3 ways of comparing textual values:
* string and character equality
* prefix equality
* suffix equality

Note that none of these methods is locale specific.

## String and Character Equality

This is checked using the standard equality operators (`==` and `!=`). Because Strings are treated as value types, it is their values rather than their references that get compared for equality. However, there are some quirks.

Swift marks Strings are considered equal if their extended graphene clusters are *canonically equivalent*. This essentially means that the two strings have the same linguistic meaning and appearance, even if they're composed of different unicode scalars. For example:
```Swift
// "Voulez-vous un café?" using LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE
let eAcuteQuestion = "Voulez-vous un caf\u{E9}?"
 
// "Voulez-vous un café?" using LATIN SMALL LETTER E and COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT
let combinedEAcuteQuestion = "Voulez-vous un caf\u{65}\u{301}?"
 
if eAcuteQuestion == combinedEAcuteQuestion {
    print("These two strings are considered equal")
}
// Prints "These two strings are considered equal"
```
Conversely, a cyrillic A and a latin A are not equivalent, as the characters look similar but have different linguistic meaning:
```Swift
let latinCapitalLetterA: Character = "\u{41}"
 
let cyrillicCapitalLetterA: Character = "\u{0410}"
 
if latinCapitalLetterA != cyrillicCapitalLetterA {
    print("These two characters are not equivalent.")
}
// Prints "These two characters are not equivalent."
```

## Prefix and Suffix Equality
The `hasPrefix(_:)` and `hasSuffix(_:)` methods allow you to check if the start or end of a string have particular contents. They operate by checking the canonical equivalence of characters one by one, in the way just described.
