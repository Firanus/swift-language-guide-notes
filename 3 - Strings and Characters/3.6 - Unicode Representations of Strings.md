# 3.6 [Unicode Representations of Strings](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH7-ID301)

When you write a Unicode string to a text file, or some other form of storage, the string is encoded in one of several Unicode-defined *encoding forms*. In each form, the string is encoded in small chunks known as *code units*. These encoding forms include:

* UTF-8 - which encodes a string as 8-bit code units
* UTF-16 - which encodes a string as 16-bit code units
* UTF-32 - which encodes a string as 32-bit code units

In addition to allowing a user to iterate over the `Characters` in a string, Swift also provides ways of accessing these Unicode representations. Strings possess special properties which allow a user to iterate over their various Unicode-compliant representations with a `for-in` loop. They are:

* `.utf8` - Which returns a collection of UTF-8 code units
* `.utf16` - Which returns a collection of UTF-16 code units
* `.unicodeScalars` - Whichreturns a collection of 21-bit Unicode scalar values that are equivalent to the string's UTF-32 encoding form.

Each example below shows a different representation of the following string, which is made up of the characters D, o, g, ‚Äº (DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK, or Unicode scalar U+203C), and the üê∂ character (DOG FACE, or Unicode scalar U+1F436):

```Swift
let dogString = "Dog‚Äºüê∂"
```

## UTF-8 Representation

The UTF-8 representation of a string is accessed by iterating over its `utf8` property. The property itself is of type `String.UTF8View`, which is collection of unsigned 8-bit integers (`UInt8`).

```Swift
for codeUnit in dogString.utf8 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 226 128 188 240 159 144 182 "
```

## UTF-16 Representation

The UTF-16 representation of a String is accessed by iterating over its `utf16` property. The property is of type `String.UTF16View`, which is a collection of unsigned 16 bit integers (`UInt16`)

![UTF-16 Representation of String](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/UTF16_2x.png)

```Swift
for codeUnit in dogString.utf16 {
    print("\(codeUnit) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 8252 55357 56374 "
```

Note how the UTF-8 and UTF-16 representations of the characters D,o and g are the same. The DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK and DOG FACE characters can be expressed more succintly here than in the UTF-8 representation.

## Unicode Scalar Representation

The final, Unicode scalar representation of a String can be accessed by iterating over its `unicodeScalars` property. This property is of type `UnicodeScalarView`, which is a collection of values of type `UnicodeScalar`

Each `UnicodeScalar` has a value property, which returns the scalar's 21-bit value, represented within a `UInt32`

![Unicode Scalar Representation of String](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Art/UnicodeScalar_2x.png)

```Swift
for scalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
    print("\(scalar.value) ", terminator: "")
}
print("")
// Prints "68 111 103 8252 128054 "
```

Note again how all 3 forms have the same representation of D,o and g. UTF-16 and the Unicode Scalars also share a representation of the DOUBLE EXCLAMATION MARK character. Finally, unicode scalars are able to represent DOG FACE in a single character.

Finally, Unicode scalars can also be used to construct a string, for instance as shown below.

```Swift
for scalar in dogString.unicodeScalars {
    print("\(scalar) ")
}
// D
// o
// g
// ‚Äº
// üê∂
```
