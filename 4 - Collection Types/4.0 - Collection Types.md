# 4.0 [Collection Types](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html)

Swift provides 3 primary collection types:
* Arrays - Ordered collections of values
* Sets - Unordered collections of unique values
* Dictionaries - Unordered collections of key-value associations

Each collection has distinct types to represent the keys and values that it can store. This prevents the user mistakenly putting an item in the wrong kind of collection.

## Mutability of Collections

Whether a collection is mutable or immutable depends on the keyword that is used to define it. If done using the `var` keyword, the collection is mutable (i.e. changeable). If it is done using the `let` keyword it is immutable (i.e. its size and contents cannot be changes).
