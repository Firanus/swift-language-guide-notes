# 4.2 [Dictionaries](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID113)

Dictionaries in Swift are similar to Dictionaries in other languages, so this post will serve as a collection of new items that stood out to me.

Dictionaries in Swift have the type `Dictionary<Key, Value>`. There is also a shorthand definition: `[Key: Value]`. As with arrays, the shorthand is prefered.

## Creating empty dictionaries

As with arrays, there is a shorthand syntax for initialising an empty dictionary:
```Swift
var namesOfIntegers = [Int: String]()
// namesOfIntegers is an empty [Int: String] dictionary
```

If you have a typed dictionary that you want to empty, there is also an empty dictionary literal that you can use: `[:]`:

```Swift
namesOfIntegers[16] = "sixteen"
// namesOfIntegers now contains 1 key-value pair
namesOfIntegers = [:]
// namesOfIntegers is once again an empty dictionary of type [Int: String]
```

## `updateValue(_:forKey:)`

One can edit Dictionaries using the shorthand syntax (e.g. `airports["LHR"] = "London Heathrow"`). However, there is also an `updateValue` method, which allows you to update the value at a specific key. Its key differences are that:
1. When you do an update, it returns the *old* value, rather than the new one, to allow a user to check if an update has occurred
2. It returns an **Optional** of the value type of the Dictionary. This accounts for the fact that the updateValue can be used to set values for new keys.

## Removing a key-value pair

There are two ways to do this:
* Set the key to `nil` directly:
   ```Swift
   airports["APL"] = nil
   // APL has now been removed from the dictionary
   ```
* Use the `removeValue(forKey:)` method. This removes the key-value pair and returns the removed value:
    ```Swift
    if let removedValue = airports.removeValue(forKey: "DUB") {
        print("The removed airport's name is \(removedValue).")
    }
    ```
    
## Iterating over a Dictionary

As with an Array, one can iterate over a dictionary using a `for-in` loop:

```Swift
for (airportCode, airportName) in airports {
    print("\(airportCode): \(airportName)")
}
// YYZ: Toronto Pearson
// LHR: London Heathrow
```

You can also use the `keys` and `values` properties of a dictionary to access the keys and values respectively.
```Swift
for airportCode in airports.keys {
    print("Airport code: \(airportCode)")
}
// Airport code: YYZ
// Airport code: LHR
 
for airportName in airports.values {
    print("Airport name: \(airportName)")
}
// Airport name: Toronto Pearson
// Airport name: London Heathrow
```

Note that dictionaries have no defined ordering. To look over the keys or values in a specific order, use the `sorted()` method on the `keys` or `values` properties.
