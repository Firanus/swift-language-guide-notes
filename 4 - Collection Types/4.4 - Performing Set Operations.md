# 4.4 [Performing Set Operations](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID490)

In addition to the standard access and modification operators, sets also provide methods for the fundamental set operations. The most common of these are illustrated below.

## Fundamental Set Operations

The illustration below depicts two sets—a and b—with the results of various set operations represented by the shaded regions.

The methods shown, and their uses are:
* `intersection(_:)` - creates a new set with values that are present in both sets
* `symmetricDifference(_:)` - creates a set of the values in either set, but not both
* `union(_:)` - creates a set of all the values in either set
* `subtracting(_:)` - creates a set of the values not in the specified set.

For example:
```Swift
let oddDigits: Set = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
let evenDigits: Set = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
let singleDigitPrimeNumbers: Set = [2, 3, 5, 7]
 
oddDigits.union(evenDigits).sorted()
// [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
oddDigits.intersection(evenDigits).sorted()
// []
oddDigits.subtracting(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 9]
oddDigits.symmetricDifference(singleDigitPrimeNumbers).sorted()
// [1, 2, 9]
```

## Set Membership and Equality

We also have methods to check set membership and equality. For instance, in the image below:

* Set a is a **superset** of b, because it contains all the elements of b
* Set b is a **subset** of a, becauee all its elements are contained in a.
* Sets b and c are **disjoint** with one another, because they contain none of the same elements.

Swift provides methods for testing these scenarios. They are:
* The "is equal" operator (`==`) - checks if two sets contain all the same values
* The `isSubset(of:)` method - checks if all the values of a set are contained in the specified set
* The `isSuperset(of:)` method - checks if the specified set contains all the values of the set
* The `isStrictSubset(of:)` and `isStrictSuperset(of:)` methods - as above, and also check that the set and specified set are not equal.
* The `isDisjoint(with:)` method - determines whether the two sets have no values in common

For example:
```Swift
let houseAnimals: Set = ["🐶", "🐱"]
let farmAnimals: Set = ["🐮", "🐔", "🐑", "🐶", "🐱"]
let cityAnimals: Set = ["🐦", "🐭"]
 
houseAnimals.isSubset(of: farmAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isSuperset(of: houseAnimals)
// true
farmAnimals.isDisjoint(with: cityAnimals)
// true
```
