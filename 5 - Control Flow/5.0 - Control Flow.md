# 5.0 [Control Flow](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html)

Swift contains your standard selection of control flow statements. `if`, `while` and `for` all behave exactly as you'd expect. However, there are a few differences:
* Instead of a foreach loop, Swift provides a `for-in` loop for looping over arrays
* do-while loops are replaced with `repeat-while` loops. Apart from the change in syntax, these are identical to standard do-while loops.
* The boolean conditionals for `if` statements are not surrounded by parentheses.
* The `switch` statement provided by Swift is considerably more powerful than that in other languages
* `guard` is a new keyword (for me at least)
