# 5.1 [For-in Loops](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-ID121)

`for-in` loops allow a user to iterate over a variety of constructs, including arrays, dictionaries, and ranges generated using the range operators. For example:

```Swift
let numberOfLegs = ["spider": 8, "ant": 6, "cat": 4]
for (animalName, legCount) in numberOfLegs {
    print("\(animalName)s have \(legCount) legs")
}
// ants have 6 legs
// spiders have 8 legs
// cats have 4 legs
```

If you don't need the value from a sequence, you can ignore the values using `_` in place of a variable name:

```Swift
let base = 3
let power = 10
var answer = 1
for _ in 1...power {
    answer *= base
}
print("\(base) to the power of \(power) is \(answer)")
// Prints "3 to the power of 10 is 59049"
```

Finally, if you want to iterate over intervals in a range (e.g. every 5th item in a sequence, you can use the `stride(from:to:by:)` or the `stride(from:through:by:)` operators (the first skips the last value, the second includes it).

```Swift
let minuteInterval = 5
for tickMark in stride(from: 0, to: minutes, by: minuteInterval) {
    // render the tick mark every 5 minutes (0, 5, 10, 15 ... 45, 50, 55)
}
```
