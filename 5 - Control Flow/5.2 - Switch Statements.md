# 5.2 [Switch Statements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-ID129)

The `switch` statement in Swift builds on the switch statement available in most C-based languages:

```Swift
let someCharacter: Character = "z"
switch someCharacter {
case "a":
    print("The first letter of the alphabet")
case "z":
    print("The last letter of the alphabet")
default:
    print("Some other character")
}
// Prints "The last letter of the alphabet"
```

## Switch statements are exhaustive

In Swift, it is necessary to exhaustively match every possible case that a value can take. In cases where this is not feasible, we can use the `default` keyword.

## No implicit fallthrough
As might be apparent from the statement above, Swift switch statements do not require a `break` clause at the end of each case. This is because Swift switch statements do not have implicit fallthrough. Instead, at the end of the first matching case of the statement, the switch statement is automatically broken out of.

Instead, `break` can be used to escape switch case statements that you want to skip. (You cannot simply refuse to include them, as switch statements in Swift must be exhaustive).

## Compound Matching
You can also match multiple statements in a single switch case. If there are enough cases, this list can extend over multiple lines:

```Swift
let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a vowel")
case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m",
     "n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:
    print("\(someCharacter) is not a vowel or a consonant")
}
// Prints "e is a vowel"
```

## Interval Matching

A switch statement can check if a value is a part of a specified range:

```Swift
let approximateCount = 62
let countedThings = "moons orbiting Saturn"
let naturalCount: String
switch approximateCount {
case 0:
    naturalCount = "no"
case 1..<5:
    naturalCount = "a few"
case 5..<12:
    naturalCount = "several"
case 12..<100:
    naturalCount = "dozens of"
case 100..<1000:
    naturalCount = "hundreds of"
default:
    naturalCount = "many"
}
print("There are \(naturalCount) \(countedThings).")
// Prints "There are dozens of moons orbiting Saturn."
```

## Tuples

You can also use tuples to test several values as part of the same `switch` statement. You can match each condition against seperate values, and use the wildcard character, `_` to match any value. For examples:

```Swift
let somePoint = (1, 1)
switch somePoint {
case (0, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is at the origin")
case (_, 0):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the x-axis")
case (0, _):
    print("\(somePoint) is on the y-axis")
case (-2...2, -2...2):
    print("\(somePoint) is inside the box")
default:
    print("\(somePoint) is outside of the box")
}
// Prints "(1, 1) is inside the box"
```

### Value Bindings

In addition, you can also temporarily tore the matched value in variables (or constants), for use in the case's body. This is called *value binding*, and is shown below:

```Swift
let anotherPoint = (2, 0)
switch anotherPoint {
case (let x, 0):
    print("on the x-axis with an x value of \(x)")
case (0, let y):
    print("on the y-axis with a y value of \(y)")
case let (x, y):
    print("somewhere else at (\(x), \(y))")
}
// Prints "on the x-axis with an x value of 2"
```

Note that this statement did not need a `default` case, as the last condition could match any value.

### `where`

A switch statement can even involve a `where` clause to check for additional constraints, for instance, introduced by comparing the values. The following example checks if the point specified falls on certain straight lines:

```Swift
let yetAnotherPoint = (1, -1)
switch yetAnotherPoint {
case let (x, y) where x == y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == y")
case let (x, y) where x == -y:
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is on the line x == -y")
case let (x, y):
    print("(\(x), \(y)) is just some arbitrary point")
}
// Prints "(1, -1) is on the line x == -y"
```
