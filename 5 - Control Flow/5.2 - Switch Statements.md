# 5.2 [Switch Statements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-ID129)

The `switch` statement in Swift builds on the switch statement available in most C-based languages:

```Swift
let someCharacter: Character = "z"
switch someCharacter {
case "a":
    print("The first letter of the alphabet")
case "z":
    print("The last letter of the alphabet")
default:
    print("Some other character")
}
// Prints "The last letter of the alphabet"
```

## Switch statements are exhaustive

In Swift, it is necessary to exhaustively match every possible case that a value can take. In cases where this is not feasible, we can use the `default` keyword.

## No implicit fallthrough
As might be apparent from the statement above, Swift switch statements do not require a `break` clause at the end of each case. This is because Swift switch statements do not have implicit fallthrough. Instead, at the end of the first matching case of the statement, the switch statement is automatically broken out of.

Instead, `break` can be used to escape switch case statements that you want to skip. (You cannot simply refuse to include them, as switch statements in Swift must be exhaustive).

## Compound Matching
You can also match multiple statements in a single switch case. If there are enough cases, this list can extend over multiple lines:

```Swift
let someCharacter: Character = "e"
switch someCharacter {
case "a", "e", "i", "o", "u":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a vowel")
case "b", "c", "d", "f", "g", "h", "j", "k", "l", "m",
     "n", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z":
    print("\(someCharacter) is a consonant")
default:
    print("\(someCharacter) is not a vowel or a consonant")
}
// Prints "e is a vowel"
```

## Interval Matching

A switch statement can check if a value is a part of a specified range:

```Swift
let approximateCount = 62
let countedThings = "moons orbiting Saturn"
let naturalCount: String
switch approximateCount {
case 0:
    naturalCount = "no"
case 1..<5:
    naturalCount = "a few"
case 5..<12:
    naturalCount = "several"
case 12..<100:
    naturalCount = "dozens of"
case 100..<1000:
    naturalCount = "hundreds of"
default:
    naturalCount = "many"
}
print("There are \(naturalCount) \(countedThings).")
// Prints "There are dozens of moons orbiting Saturn."
```
