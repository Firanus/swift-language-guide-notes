# 5.3 [Control Transfer Statements](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-ID135)

These statements change the order in which your code is executed. In Swift there are 5:
* `continue`
* `break`
* `fallthrough`
* `return`
* `throw`

In this note we will look at the first 3. `return` is covered in Functions, and `throw` is covered in error handling.

## `continue`

This behaves exactly as in other languages; it ends the current iteration of the loop and resumes at the start of the next iteration of the loop. e.g.:

```Swift
let puzzleInput = "great minds think alike"
var puzzleOutput = ""
let charactersToRemove: [Character] = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u", " "]
for character in puzzleInput {
    if charactersToRemove.contains(character) {
        continue
    } else {
        puzzleOutput.append(character)
    }
}
print(puzzleOutput)
// Prints "grtmndsthnklk"
```

## `break`

In loops, break behaves in exactly the same way as it does in other languages; it ends the current loop and resumes code after the loop's closing brace (`}`)

In a `switch` statement, `break` is used to allow certain conditions in the loop to be skipped. This is because
1. Every switch case block must contain an executable statement
2. Switch statements do not have implicit fallthrough, so break statements are not needed as they are in other langauges.

## `fallthrough`

Because `switch` statements do not have fallthrough as they do in C, Swift has the `fallthrough` keyword to allow this behaviour when necessary, as in the folowing example:

```Swift
let integerToDescribe = 5
var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
switch integerToDescribe {
case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
    description += " a prime number, and also"
    fallthrough
default:
    description += " an integer."
}
print(description)
// Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."
```

Note that when using the `fallthrough` keyword, the `case` statement into which the code is falling is not checked. It simply causes execution to move to the next `case` (or `default`) Thus, be careful when employing it.
