# 5.4 [Early Exit](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ControlFlow.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH9-ID525)

The `guard` statement is similar to the `if` statement. The difference is that the `guard` statement *requires* an else statement. If the condition of the if statement is met, then execution of the code after the guard statement's closing brace will execute, and any optional binding you've done will persist for the remainder of the code block.

If the condition is not met, then the else statement is invoked. At the end of it, some form of control flow statement (e.g. `return`, `break`, `continue`, `throw`) or a function with no return such as `fatalError(_:file:line:)` must be invoked. The goal of this is to improve readability, by keeping violated requirements next to the requirements in question.

```Swift
func greet(person: [String: String]) {
    guard let name = person["name"] else {
        return
    }
    
    print("Hello \(name)!")
    
    guard let location = person["location"] else {
        print("I hope the weather is nice near you.")
        return
    }
    
    print("I hope the weather is nice in \(location).")
}
 
greet(person: ["name": "John"])
// Prints "Hello John!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice near you."
greet(person: ["name": "Jane", "location": "Cupertino"])
// Prints "Hello Jane!"
// Prints "I hope the weather is nice in Cupertino."
```
