# 6.0 [Functions](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Functions.html)

Swift, like literally all the programming languages, has functions, with their own quirks of syntax. All standard features of functions (e.g. taking different number of variables, returning values, and nesting functions to control scope) are covered. In this section, we will largely look at things unique to Swift or comparitively niche enough that a reader might not have encountered them before.

A standard Swift function is replicated below, to show the basic syntax. Note the use of the `func` keyword to delcare the function, the `:` syntax for naming functions, and the use of `->` to show a return type.

```Swift
func greet(person: String) -> String {
    let greeting = "Hello, " + person + "!"
    return greeting
}
```
