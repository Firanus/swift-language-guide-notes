# 6.2 [Functions with Multiple Return Values](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Functions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH10-ID164)

You can use a Tuple to return multiple values from a function as part of one compound return value. To assist with getting the results of such a function, you can also name the values within the tuple:

```Swift
func minMax(array: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int) {
    var currentMin = array[0]
    var currentMax = array[0]
    for value in array[1..<array.count] {
        if value < currentMin {
            currentMin = value
        } else if value > currentMax {
            currentMax = value
        }
    }
    return (currentMin, currentMax)
}

let bounds = minMax(array: [8, -6, 2, 109, 3, 71])
print("min is \(bounds.min) and max is \(bounds.max)")
// Prints "min is -6 and max is 109"
```

## Optional Tuple Return Types

If it's possible for the returned tuple to take no value, you can additionally make it optional. For example, giving it a type of `(Int, Int)?`. Note that this is different from a type `(Int?, Int?)`, as in the former, you are stating that the **entire tuple** could be rendered `nil`. For example, to allow our earlier example to check for an empty array (note the different decleration on line 1 and the return on line 2):

```Swift
func minMax(array: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int)? {
    if array.isEmpty { return nil }
    var currentMin = array[0]
    var currentMax = array[0]
    for value in array[1..<array.count] {
        if value < currentMin {
            currentMin = value
        } else if value > currentMax {
            currentMax = value
        }
    }
    return (currentMin, currentMax)
}
```

As with regular optionals, you can use optional binding to check whether the tuple has been set:

```Swift
if let bounds = minMax(array: [8, -6, 2, 109, 3, 71]) {
    print("min is \(bounds.min) and max is \(bounds.max)")
}
// Prints "min is -6 and max is 109"
```
