# 6.3 [Function Types](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Functions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH10-ID174)

Every function has a specific *function type* made up of the parameter types and the return type. For instance, both the following functions have the type `(Int, Int) -> Int` (read as "a function that takes two integers, and returns an integer"):

```Swift
func addTwoInts(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}
func multiplyTwoInts(_ a: Int, _ b: Int) -> Int {
    return a * b
}
```

Whereas the following function has the type `() -> Void` (read as "a function that has no parameters and returns Void"):

```Swift
func printHelloWorld() {
    print("hello, world")
}
```

## Using Function Types

Function types can be used just like regular types. For instance we can define a variable `mathFunction` with the same type as out earlier addition function:

```Swift
var mathFunction: (Int, Int) -> Int = addTwoInts
```

We can call `mathFunction`:

```Swift
print("Result: \(mathFunction(2, 3))")
// Prints "Result: 5"
```

And we can reassign it:

```Swift
mathFunction = multiplyTwoInts
print("Result: \(mathFunction(2, 3))")
// Prints "Result: 6"
```

Type inference is also in play. So we did not need to declare the type when defining `mathFunction`. The following is equally valid:

```Swift
let anotherMathFunction = addTwoInts
// anotherMathFunction is inferred to be of type (Int, Int) -> Int
```

## Function Types as Parameter Types

You can give parameters in your function declarations function types. This allows you to use some aspect of the function's implementation in the function's body:

```Swift
func printMathResult(_ mathFunction: (Int, Int) -> Int, _ a: Int, _ b: Int) {
    print("Result: \(mathFunction(a, b))")
}
printMathResult(addTwoInts, 3, 5)
// Prints "Result: 8"
```

This is a type-safe way of passing functionality from your function to its caller in some way, as the function is no longer interested in what the function it has been passed actually does.

## Function Types as Return Values

You can also have a function type as a return type. For instance, the following two functions both have type `(Int) -> Int`

```Swift
func stepForward(_ input: Int) -> Int {
    return input + 1
}
func stepBackward(_ input: Int) -> Int {
    return input - 1
}
```

If we wanted a function which chose betwee them, it could have a declaration like the following:

```Swift
func chooseStepFunction(backward: Bool) -> (Int) -> Int {
    return backward ? stepBackward : stepForward
}
```

This function now returns either `stepForward` or `stepBackward` depending on its input. For example:

```Swift
var currentValue = 3
let moveNearerToZero = chooseStepFunction(backward: currentValue > 0)
// moveNearerToZero now refers to the stepBackward() function
```
