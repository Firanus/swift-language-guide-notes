# 7.0 [Classes and Structures](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-ID82)

Like other languages, Swift supports custom classes and structures. However, in Swift:
* You are not required to define seperate interface and implementation files. By defining a class, the external interface is automatically made available for other code to use.
* Classes and Structures in Swift are much closer in functionality than in other languages. However, they do have differences that we will explore in this section.
