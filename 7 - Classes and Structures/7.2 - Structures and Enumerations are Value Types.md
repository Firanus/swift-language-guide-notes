# 7.2 [Structures and Enumerations are Value Types](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-ID88)

A *value type* is a type whose value is *copied* when it is assigned to a variable or constant, or when it is passed to a function.

All structures (and enumerations) in Swift are value types. This means you can copy and reassign properties without fear, as in the following example:

```Swift
let hd = Resolution(width: 1920, height: 1080)
var cinema = hd

cinema.width = 2048

print("cinema is now \(cinema.width) pixels wide")
// Prints "cinema is now 2048 pixels wide"

print("hd is still \(hd.width) pixels wide")
// Prints "hd is still 1920 pixels wide"
```

Note that many basic Swift data types, such as `String`, `Array`, and `Dictionary` are implemented as structures
