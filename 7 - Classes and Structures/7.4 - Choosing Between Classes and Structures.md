# 7.4 [Choosing Between Classes and Structures](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-ID92)

The main difference between classes and structures is that the former is pass by reference, and the latter is pass by value. So it is important to take this into account when deciding how you should define your data. Structures are often valid when the following conditions apply:

* The structureâ€™s primary purpose is to encapsulate a few relatively simple data values.
* It is reasonable to expect that the encapsulated values will be copied rather than referenced when you assign or pass around an instance of that structure.
* Any properties stored by the structure are themselves value types, which would also be expected to be copied rather than referenced.
* The structure does not need to inherit properties or behavior from another existing type.
