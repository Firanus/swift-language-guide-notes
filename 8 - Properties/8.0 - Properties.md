# 8.0 [Properties](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Properties.html)

Much as in all other programming languages, properties associate values with a particular class, structure or enumeration. Swift also provides computed properties to the 3 above types, which significantly expands the scope of what enumerations can do.

Properties are normally associated with *instances* of a particular type. However, you can also associate properties with the type itself. These are called *type properties*, and are defined much as they are in other languages, using the `static` keyword.

As with the last few sections, we will focus on unique Swift items and the less routine features.
