# 8.1 [Stored Properties](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH14-ID255)

These are your standard stored properties, defined against a class or structure (though not an enumeration).

## Stored Properties of Constant Structure Instances

If you create a constant instance of a structure, the properties of the instance also become constant.

```Swift
let rangeOfFourItems = FixedLengthRange(firstValue: 0, length: 4)
// this range represents integer values 0, 1, 2, and 3
rangeOfFourItems.firstValue = 6
// this will report an error, even though firstValue is a variable property
```

## Lazy Stored Properties

A *lazy stored property* is a property whose initial value is not calculated until the first time it is used. It is defined by using the `lazy` keyword. Note that lazy properties must always be defined as variables (i.e. using the `var` keyword), as they are usually set after class initialisation finishes. An example:

```Swift
class DataManager {
    lazy var importer = DataImporter()
    var data = [String]()
    // the DataManager class would provide data management functionality here
}
```

Note that If a property marked with the `lazy` modifier is accessed by multiple threads simultaneously and the property has not yet been initialized, there is no guarantee that the property will be initialized only once.

Note also that all global constants and variable are defined lazily, without requiring the keyword to be used.
