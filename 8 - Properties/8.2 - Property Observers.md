# 8.2 [Property Observers](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Properties.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH14-ID262)

Property observers observe and respond to changes in a property's value. They are called every time a property is set (even if the value does not change). You can observe properties on any stored properties you define, except `lazy` properties.

There are two observers you can define on a property:
* `willSet` - which:
  * Is called just before the property is stored. 
  * If implemented, this observer is passed the **new** property value as a constant, which the user can name. If they do not, it is given the default name `newValue`.
* `didSet` - which:
  * Is called just after the property is stored. 
  * If implemented, the observer is passed the **old** property name as a constant, which again, the user can name. If they do not, its default name is `oldValue`
  * If you assign a value to a property within its own didSet observer, the new value that you assign replaces the one that was just set.

An example implementation:
```Swift
class StepCounter {
    var totalSteps: Int = 0 {
        willSet(newTotalSteps) {
            print("About to set totalSteps to \(newTotalSteps)")
        }
        didSet {
            if totalSteps > oldValue  {
                print("Added \(totalSteps - oldValue) steps")
            }
        }
    }
}
let stepCounter = StepCounter()
stepCounter.totalSteps = 200
// About to set totalSteps to 200
// Added 200 steps
stepCounter.totalSteps = 360
// About to set totalSteps to 360
// Added 160 steps
stepCounter.totalSteps = 896
// About to set totalSteps to 896
// Added 536 steps
```
