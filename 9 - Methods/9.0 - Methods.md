# 9.0 [Methods](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Methods.html)

As with all the languages, Swift employs methods. Interestingly however, Swift allows both structures and enumerations to have methods (as well as classes of course).

Swift also allows type methods (defined against a type rather than an instance), defined using the `static` keyword, in an analagous way to other languages. Classes may also use the `class` keyword to allow subclasses to override the superclass's implementation;

```Swift
class SomeClass {
    class func someTypeMethod() {
        // type method implementation goes here
    }
}
SomeClass.someTypeMethod()
```
