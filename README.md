# Swift Language Guide Notes

This repository compiles notes made on the Swift language guide. The order in which the notes were made was dictated by the Stanford course 'Developing iOS 11 apps with Swift 4', and the releases reflect the reading exercises made in that course.

Attempts have been made to keep the notes as brief as possible, and omit content that would be intuitive to a programmer of moderate skill. Bear this in mind. If you ever feel you need more detail, there is no better source than the [official language guide itself](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/TheBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH5-ID309)
